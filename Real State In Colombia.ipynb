Nevertheless, these days people have become more conscious about the importance of investing, whether if it is in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, commodities or real state. This is due to facilities that the modern world gives to us, and not taking advantage of them would be a mistake."

These are the main 2 reasons why people prefer real state instead of choosing other investment mechanism that sometimes can be more profitable but can imply higher risks.\nThe purpose of this project is to make a deep analysis of real investment in Colombia. Think in your self as a foreign investor that wants to live in Colombia and open a business, but you have never traveled there. For this reason, you would like to know which are the best cities for buying a house and having a good return of investment after some years."
